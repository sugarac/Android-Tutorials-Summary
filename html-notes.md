1. The &lt;div&gt; tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

   The &lt;div&gt; tag is used to group block-elements to format them with CSS.  
   Tip: The &lt;div&gt; element is very often used together with CSS, to layout a web page.

   Note: By default, browsers always place a line break before and after the &lt;div&gt; element. However, this can be changed with CSS.

2. HTML elements are usually either "block-level" elements or "inline" elements.   
   A block-level element occupies the entire space of its parent element \(container\), thereby creating a "block".  
   Inline elements are those which only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead of breaking the flow of the content. &lt;b&gt;, &lt;td&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;span&gt;  
   **Formatting**

   By default, block-level elements begin on new lines, but inline elements can start anywhere in a line.

   **Content model**

   Generally, block-level elements may contain inline elements and other block-level elements. Inherent in this structural distinction is the idea that block elements create "larger" structures than inline elements.
