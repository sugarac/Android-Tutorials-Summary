1. An important difference between JavaScript and other languages like Java is that in JavaScript, blocks do not have scope; only functions have scope. So if a variable is defined using var in a compound statement \(for example inside an if control structure\), it will be visible to the entire function. However, starting with ECMAScript 2015, let and const declarations allow you to create block-scoped variables.
2. Spread syntax（扩展语法，任意长参数） allows an iterable such as an array expression or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments \(for function calls\) or elements \(for array literals\) are expected, or an object expression to be expanded in places where zero or more key-value pairs \(for object literals\) are expected.
